create the concept of an expense item
    has name, frequency, expense amount

save data includes income

budgeter interface
    income (monthly, hourly, biweekly, annual salary?)
    add new expense
    area for how to divide up the remaining amount? (could have fun money, savings, investments, etc.)
        these could also just be included in the expenses itemization...
    remaining total (positive or negative need to be super distinct with negative being a bold, bad red)
    other statistics? since not all values will be monthly I could have a monthly breakdown...

each expense line
    name, frequency, amount, checkbox (include/uninclude - checked by default), delete/remove button
