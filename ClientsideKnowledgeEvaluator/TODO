LOADER:
the file selection portion needs instructions, possibly with illustrations (though until directory names are finalized this would be premature)

TEST ADMINISTRATOR:
timed test mode? <- even though it was my idea, I'm leaning toward no on this one (Brian)
results mode filtering dropdown instead of toggle button to show or hide correct questions
    could select from All, Correct Only, Incorrect Only, Unanswered Only, Marked Only, etc.

QUESTION JSON MANAGER:
filename entry
    need to be able to hit enter to accept?
        could put original object into a "submit on enter" entity based on a form whose submit is a javascript action
