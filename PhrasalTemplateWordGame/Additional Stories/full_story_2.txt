    I won a free, all-expense paid vacation to [noun] beach.
    When I arrived, the first thing I did was put on my [thing] and went straight to the beach.
    As I was gazing out on the water I was suddenly surprised to see a [thing] coming up out of the ocean right in front of me.
    But I was even more surprised to see a [thing] coming out of it and moving toward me.
    Before it reached me, I heard a loud sound coming from the air. I looked up to see a [thing]. 
    Just as I was getting over the shock of both these unexpected arrivals, the ground under my feet began to shake and a huge hole formed in the sand. Out of the hole arose a [thing].
    Now I had a decision to make. I reached into my beach bag and pulled out a [thing]. I was hoping I would not need it, but thank goodness I packed it.
    I spent the rest of the day with [person] just [verb ending with -ing].
    It was a vacation I will always remember.
