# Phrasal Template Word Game
This is a word game where the user can input word that will appear in a story, often resulting in silly or unusual phrases.

There are multiple versions.
* Simple: this is a project designed to be taught within about 30 minutes worth of coding (leaving up to an additional hour for explanations, questions, and troubleshooting).
* Intermediate: this one shows off some minor changes to the simple code that will enhance the programmer's skills and improve the user experience.
* Advanced: this version is a challenge version where the entire user experience is improved, greatly increasing the complexity of the code.

Getting from one version to the next requires increasingly greater understandings and skills.

Objectives:
* Don't worry about the nitty gritty of "good" javascript. Just write code that works and learn basic concepts.
* Try implementing some of the intermediate features on your own, without looking at the final version of the code.

# Teaching Agenda
Try to touch on the following points of interest as you present the code and work the students through completing the project.

## Download and Setup
Ideally, the final story should be a surprise for the student. It's more fun that way. You can choose to provide the story in the initial download or give it to them at the end and use a dummy file for development.

This project can be completed with Notepad or some other basic text editor, but some students may wish to work in VS Code or Notepad++. The students can be encouraged to look into advanced text editors for programming and make a selection before the class. They can install the software ahead of time and learn to use it to create, edit, and save a basic text file.

Some students may struggle with saving files with a particular extension, should the need arise. The simple version of this project does not require creating any new files or documents, though in order to complete some of the more advanced features they may need help setting their operating system to display extensions, or at least learning to use their text editor to override the default filetype.
