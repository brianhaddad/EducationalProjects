# Phrasal Template Word Game
This is a word game where the user can input word that will appear in a story, often resulting in silly or unusual phrases.

There are multiple versions.
* Simple: this is a project designed to be taught within about 30 minutes worth of coding (leaving up to an additional hour for explanations, questions, and troubleshooting).
* Intermediate: this one shows off some minor changes to the simple code that will enhance the programmer's skills and improve the user experience.
* Advanced: this version is a challenge version where the entire user experience is improved, greatly increasing the complexity of the code.

Getting from one version to the next requires increasingly greater understandings and skills.

Objectives:
* Don't worry about the nitty gritty of "good" javascript. Just write code that works and learn basic concepts.
* Try implementing some of the intermediate features on your own, without looking at the final version of the code.
