# EducationalProjects
Various little projects used to educate or demonstrate coding concepts to others.

## PhrasalTemplateWordGame
This is a project designed to be an introduction to writing code. It doesn't focus on particular elements of the code, just introduces a few basic concepts in a project that might spark interest for the student. It is designed to leave the student with a project that has known bugs and definite improvements that could be made. A followup session would include fixing the bugs and beginning to make the improvements. This second session would focus on teaching the student how to learn how to code by knowing what to search for in the documentation and where to find good information online.

## ClientsideKnowledgeEvaluator
This was a project that is an update of a much older project I made while in the military. I have included it here due to its utility in educational situations, not necessarily as a project that students should work on or create (though for advanced students it would be a fun exercise to have them attempt to create a project that replicates some of its features). It is effectively a tool for creating and administering simple tests with multiple choice options (select one or many correct answers).

## BudgetTool
This is currently in development. It's a project to help with budgeting. It's educational in the sense that I'm going to try to engineer it in an easy-to-understand way so that it could potentially be a project for students someday, plus it will help teach budgeting.
