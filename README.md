## PhrasalTemplateWordGame
This is a project designed to be an introduction to writing code. It doesn't focus on particular elements of the code, just introduces a few basic concepts in a project that might spark interest for the student. It is designed to leave the student with a project that has known bugs and definite improvements that could be made. A followup session would include fixing the bugs and beginning to make the improvements. This second session would focus on teaching the student how to learn how to code by knowing what to search for in the documentation and where to find good information online.
